# Mapping Earthquakes

In this project we used APIs, JavaScript, Leaflet, and geoJSON to create an earthquake map that can be observed in three different styles: street, satellite, or dark view. The map contains earthquake data, earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plate's location on earth, and it also shows major earthquakes with a 4.5 or higher magnitude.
